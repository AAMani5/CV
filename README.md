<p>I am a curious and enthusiastic Software Developer in training, who loves solving problems and enjoys learning new technologies.</p>

<p>After finishing Master in Physics with Honours, I accepted a challenging and demanding role in a leading oil and gas services company and had the opportunity to travel around the world undertaking projects in remote locations, usually as the only female engineer on-site. Although I cherished every moment in my previous role, it involved staying at remote locations for extended periods with no way to contact the outside world on most days.</p>

<p>As a self-motivated person, I enjoy developing new skills that empower me to design solutions that would change people's lives for the better. I am most productive when working with passionate technologists in an encouraging environment.</p>


## Skills

#### Analytical Reasoning

In my previous role, my main responsibility was to analyse and interpret data acquired from oil wells to produce reports which would help companies like Chevron, Cairn Energy, ONGC make decisions on productivity, exploration, abandonment and repair of the oil wells. These reports had to be precise and evidence based, as they impacted multi-million dollar project decisions.

#### Leadership

<p>As a sole company representative at client location, I had to evaluate a well-site job against the company’s quality, health, safety and environmental standards to provide an engineered on-site solution. Furthermore, I was responsible for managing my crew and assets (usually proprietary multi-million dollar equipment)</p>
<p>I led the first ever Connex perforation campaign in India, leading to increase in oil productivity. In addition to that, I was one of ten engineers worldwide at that time to spearhead a logging campaign which helped uncover secondary oil reserves in old wells.</p>
<p>I was voted to be Loss Prevention team leader for my excellent Health, Safety and Environment initiatives and track record.</p>

#### Communication

<p>In my previous role, I met with client-representative everyday to provide updates on the progress of the task at hand – be it troubleshooting, job design or job progress. Among my peers, I was invited to update them regarding new hi-tech equipment, to choose the most suited equipment for the job because I was knowledgeable and maintained a good working relationship with clients. </p>
<p>At Makers Academy I have improved my communication skills further by getting feedback from my coaches and team members.</p>

#### Fast-learner

<p>During my first intensive training with Schlumberger, my coaches and peers assumed that I was a Petroleum Engineer because of the speed and ease with which I was picking up new concepts and applying them at work.</p>
<p>At Makers Academy, I was able to quickly grasp fundamental object-oriented programming concepts early on which helped me appreciate SOLID principles and use them in my projects.</p>
