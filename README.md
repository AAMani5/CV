## Ashwini Mani

<p>I am a curious and enthusiastic Software Developer in training, who loves solving problems and enjoys learning new technologies.</p>

<p>After finishing Master in Physics (Hons), I accepted a challenging and demanding role in a leading oil and gas services company and had the opportunity to travel around the world undertaking projects in remote locations, usually as the only female engineer on-site. Although I cherished every moment in my previous role, it kept me away from my family often with no way to contact the outside world on most days.</p>

<p>As a self-motivated person, I look forward to developing skills that would allow me to design solutions which would change people's live for the better and working along side passionate technologist, in an encouraging environment.</p>


## Skills

#### Analytical Reasoning

In my previous role, my main responsibility was to analyze and interpret data acquired from oil wells to produce reports which would help companies like Chevron, Cairn Energy, ONGC make decisions on productivity, exploration, abandonment and repair of the oil wells. These reports had to be precise and evidence based, as they impacted multi-million dollar project decisions.

#### Leadership

<p>As a sole company representative at client location, I had to evaluate a well-site job against the company’s quality, health, safety and environmental standards to provide an engineered on-site solution. Furthermore, I was responsible for managing my crew and assets (usually proprietary multi-million dollar equipment)</p>
<p>I led the first ever Connex perforation campaign in India, leading to increase in oil productivity. In addition to that, I was one of ten engineers worldwide at that time to spearhead a logging campaign which helped uncover secondary oil reserves in old wells.</p>
<p>I was voted to be Loss Prevention team leader for my excellent Health, Safety and Environment initiatives and track record.</p>

#### Communication

<p>In my previous role, I met with client-representative everyday to provide updates on the progress of the task at hand – be it troubleshooting, job design or job progress. Among my peers, I was invited to update them regarding new hi-tech equipment, to choose the most suited equipment for the job because I was knowledgeable and maintained a good working relationship with clients. </p>
<p>Based on my performance and integrity on the job, clients have specifically requested for me to be assigned to carry out some atypical jobs.</p>

#### Fast-learner

<p>I set a record for the fastest time taken to complete a heavy-duty crane operation certification, in spite of spending only 15 minutes to learn the controls, surprising the trainer and the location manager. Managers have specifically asked for me to read up on new technologies and to arrange for training my peers because of my ability to learn efficiently and for my attention to detail.</p>
