## Ashwini Mani

<p>I am a curious and enthusiastic Software Developer in training, who loves solving problems and enjoys learning new technologies.</p>

<p>After finishing Master in Physics (Hons), I accepted a challenging and demanding role in a leading oil and gas services company and had the opportunity to travel around the world. Although I cherished every moment in my previous role, it kept me away from my family often with no way to contact the outside world on most days.</p>

<p>As a self-motivated person, I look forward to developing skills that would allow me to design solutions which would change people's live for the better and working along side passionate technologist, in an encouraging environment.</p>
